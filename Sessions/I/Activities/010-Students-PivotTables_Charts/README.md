# Pivot Tables

* Open exploration: Create a few pivot charts from pivot tables.

* Create a hierarchical plot (treemap or suburst) from the pivot table data
  * Note: it is not possible to create a hierarchical plot from a pivot table, but you can copy it's data into another sheet, clean some of the rows, extend the keys and plot the cleaned data.
